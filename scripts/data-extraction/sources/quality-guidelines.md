# Source Snippet Quality Guidelines

## Quality Score Ranges

- **0-49**: Low quality, needs revision
- **50-69**: Acceptable, usable but basic
- **70-79**: Good quality, well-structured
- **80-89**: High quality, detailed and interesting
- **90-100**: Exemplary, Therios-level quality

## Quality Criteria (Based on Therios Samples)

### Minimum Quality (50+)
- Clear excerpt describing the character/concept
- At least 3 relevant tags
- Basic archetype classification
- One conflict hook or story element
- Basic mechanics (if applicable)

### High Quality (80+)
- **Rich excerpt**: Detailed description with roleplay cues embedded naturally
- **Comprehensive tags**: 5+ relevant, searchable tags
- **Clear archetype**: Well-defined character/concept type
- **Active conflict**: Specific, actionable conflict hook
- **Roleplay cues**: 2-3 behavioral patterns for DM use
- **World context**: Culture, biome, tone specified
- **Complete mechanics**: Full stats/equipment if applicable
- **Language quality**: Vivid, engaging prose (not generic)

### Exemplary Quality (90+)
- All high-quality criteria met
- **Unique concept**: Distinctive, memorable character/concept
- **Rich sensory details**: Voice, mannerisms, appearance cues
- **Multiple hooks**: Conflict + quest hooks + services
- **World integration**: Clear connections to locations/factions
- **DM-ready**: Can be used immediately at table

## Language Use (Based on Therios Samples)

### Good Examples
- "Speaks in hushed present-tense ('History is happening... now.')"
- "Pauses mid-sentence to take deep volcanic-steam breaths"
- "Laughs in meteorological metaphors; jingles with orbiting motes"

### Avoid
- Generic descriptions: "A wizard who studies magic"
- Vague conflicts: "Has problems"
- No roleplay cues: Just stats and basic info

## Tagging Best Practices

- Use lowercase, hyphenated tags: `npc`, `wizard`, `urban`, `mysterious`
- Include type: `npc`, `location`, `item`, `puzzle`, `hook`
- Include race/class if applicable: `tiefling`, `dwarf`, `monk`, `cleric`
- Include setting: `urban`, `underground`, `astral`, `river`
- Include tone: `mysterious`, `grounded`, `whimsical`, `caring`
- Include mechanics: `combat-focused`, `social`, `exploration`

## Notes

- **Don't force strict Therios format**: Use as quality/detail guide, not template
- **Variety is key**: Different archetypes, conflicts, tones
- **DM usability**: Every snippet should be immediately usable at table
- **Story integration**: Conflicts and hooks should connect to world elements
