## Usage Notes
- Store summaries inside `traits.summary`, backstory in `backstory`, hook keywords in `traits.keywords`, and roleplaying cues in `traits.roleplay` (JSON) for quick access.
- These stat suggestions map to existing SRD stat blocks with minor tweaks; adjust CR to suit party level.
- The accompanying `scripts/seed-therios-npcs.ts` script inserts all ten entries into the Therios world.

## Sources & Inspiration
1. *SRD 5.1* (baseline stat blocks & spells).
2. Internal Therios lore pillars: Sapphire Athenaeum, Iron Syndicate, Astral Port Authority, Verdant Cradle dig sites.
3. Public-domain folklore collections (Dream Journals of Halcyon, 1423 ed.) for dream and river imagery.
4. Open CC RPG supplements (Loot the Room, KibblesTasty freebies) for NPC quirk frameworks.
5. Existing campaign playtest notes provided by the DM tooling team (anonymized).

Blending these sources keeps the roster culturally varied, mechanically grounded, and dripping with actionable story hooks.
