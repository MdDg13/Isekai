# Therios NPC Reference Pack

Each entry below follows the “hook + conflict + playable detail” pattern and is ready to paste into the world database. The quick summary mirrors the structure enforced by the generator (bio, summary bullets, conflict, motive).

| # | Name | Snapshot | Conflict Hook | Quirks / Utilities |
|---|------|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Eris Thornwell** – Tiefling archivist | Curates a forbidden wing of the Sapphire Athenaeum and records dreams as history. | Her patron demon demands she “correct” history to favor an infernal dynasty. | Sleepwalks while writing; pages contain prophecies when read backward. |
| 2 | **Bram Coalhook** – Dwarven tunnel-monk | Former mercenary who founded a meditation order inside a magma duct. | The Iron Syndicate wants his tunnels as a smuggling route. | Uses pressure-point strikes that extinguish torches; brews calming tea from volcanic herbs. |
| 3 | **Lysa Quillwater** – Human itinerant judge | Travels with a clockwork scale that weighs intent rather than goods. | Guilty nobles have placed a price on her head. | Can deputize PCs with parchment badges that glow when oaths are broken. |
| 4 | **Tovin Starfallow** – Elven meteor shepherd | Herds falling stars into crystal nets for spellcasters. | The Astral Port Authority accuses him of tax evasion on cosmic debris. | Has a stable of “shooting star” familiars that illuminate sky routes. |
| 5 | **Mara Driftline** – Halfling river warden | Guards a floating temple barge that houses refugees. | A plague cult insists the barge carries their “chosen vectors.” | Reads currents like tea leaves; can hide an entire fleet in fog she summons. |
| 6 | **Gregor Vox** – Warforged gossipwright | Embeds resonant crystals in taverns to record oral history. | A tyrant wants the recordings erased before a rebellion trial. | Plays memories aloud as illusions; drinks oil mixed with espresso. |
| 7 | **Selene Blackfen** – Half-elf mirror ranger | Tracks creatures across planar reflections. | Her soul is split; “other Selene” trades favors with shadow courts. | Can manifest the last thing a mirror saw for one round. |
| 8 | **Oro Finch** – Kenku bone-luthier | Crafts instruments from dinosaurs unearthed in Therios. | The Paleontological Guild claims he desecrates sacred fossils. | Instruments grant bardic inspiration flavored by specific dinosaurs (rage, tranquility, stealth). |
| 9 | **Nadina Brassveil** – Dragonborn lightning broker | Sells bottled storms to artificers. | A storm giant wants his stolen thundercloud back. | Lightning tattoos arc between clients, letting her eavesdrop magically. |
|10 | **Brother Cale Driftveil** – Human penitent vampire | Keeps himself anaemic by donating blood to orphanages he funds. | His sire wants the tithe stopped and the orphans turned into a thrall choir. | Uses mirrored gauntlets to reflect sunlight; carries contracts that bind fiends into monastery service. |

## Usage Notes
- Each NPC above includes enough high-signal details (occupation, active threat, quirk) to slot directly into Therios.
- Conflicts were designed to intersect with existing factions (Sapphire Athenaeum, Iron Syndicate, etc.). Swap names if your canon differs.
- When seeding the database, store the structured summary under `traits.summary`, longer narrative in `backstory`, and note the active conflict in `traits.keywords`.
