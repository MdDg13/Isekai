# NPC Prompt Analysis: "shy dwarf, training to become a wizard, against parent's wishes"

## Prompt Breakdown

### Key Elements:
1. **"shy dwarf"** → Race: Dwarf | Personality: Shy/timid/reserved
2. **"training to become a wizard"** → Class: Wizard/Spellcaster | Level: 1 (apprentice) | Status: Learning/studying
3. **"against parent's wishes"** → Conflict: Family disapproval | Motivation: Defiance/secret pursuit

### What Makes a GOOD Interpretation:

✅ **Race**: Must be **dwarf** (not ignored or changed)
✅ **Class**: Must be **wizard** or **spellcaster** (not ignored)
✅ **Level**: Should be **1** (apprentice/training)
✅ **Personality**: Should reflect **shyness** (timid, reserved, quiet, avoids attention)
✅ **Backstory**: Must include **family conflict** (parents disapprove of magic)
✅ **Coherence**: All elements connect logically (e.g., why parents disapprove - traditional dwarf values)
✅ **Specificity**: Concrete details, not vague references
✅ **Grammar**: Third person only ("they/their/them", never "I/me/my")

### Common FAILURES:

❌ Ignoring explicit class request (e.g., generating a warrior or rogue)
❌ Ignoring race (e.g., generating human or elf)
❌ Using prompt text as the NPC's name
❌ Vague descriptions ("a punishment", "an event", "something")
❌ First-person grammar ("I am", "my", "me")
❌ Broken bio sentences ("known for X and Y")
❌ Missing logical connections (why parents disapprove, how they're training)

## Example NPCs (5 Good Interpretations)

### Example 1: Thorin Spellweaver
**Keywords**: shy, dwarf, wizard, apprentice, against parents wishes

**Bio**: A timid dwarf apprentice who secretly studies arcane magic despite their family's long tradition of mining and smithing.

**Backstory**: Born into a clan of renowned miners, Thorin was expected to follow in their parents' footsteps and work the deep mines. However, they discovered an ancient spellbook hidden in a forgotten tunnel and became fascinated with magic. Their parents, staunch traditionalists who view magic as unnatural and dangerous, have forbidden any study of the arcane arts. Thorin now practices spells in secret, using abandoned mine shafts as makeshift study chambers, always fearful of discovery but driven by an insatiable curiosity about the arcane.

**Traits**:
- **Class**: Wizard
- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Level**: 1
- **Ideal**: Knowledge (they believe understanding magic will help their people)
- **Bond**: The hidden spellbook that started their journey
- **Flaw**: Fear of disappointing their family

**Stats**: High Intelligence (wizard primary), low Charisma (shy), moderate Constitution (dwarf racial)

### Example 2: Balin Ironforge
**Keywords**: dwarf, shy, wizard training, family disapproval

**Bio**: A reserved dwarf apprentice mage who hides their magical studies from their warrior parents, practicing spells in secret while pretending to train as a blacksmith.

**Backstory**: Balin's parents are respected warriors in their clan, and they expected their child to become a fighter like them. However, after witnessing a traveling wizard save their village from a goblin raid, Balin became determined to learn magic. Their parents view spellcasting as cowardly compared to honorable melee combat, so Balin pretends to be learning smithing while actually studying magic with a sympathetic scholar in a nearby town. They struggle with guilt over the deception but cannot abandon their dream of becoming a wizard.

**Traits**:
- **Class**: Wizard
- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Level**: 1
- **Ideal**: Protection (they want to protect others like the wizard did)
- **Bond**: The scholar who secretly teaches them
- **Flaw**: Guilt over lying to their parents

**Stats**: High Intelligence, low Charisma (shy and conflicted), moderate Strength (from pretending to smith)

### Example 3: Gareth Runestone
**Keywords**: shy dwarf, becoming wizard, parent conflict

**Bio**: A quiet dwarf breaking from their clan's warrior path to pursue arcane arts, studying magic in defiance of their parents' expectations.

**Backstory**: Gareth's family has served as guards and warriors for generations, and their parents planned for them to join the clan's military. However, Gareth was always more interested in books than blades, and after finding a damaged spell scroll in a battlefield, they became obsessed with learning magic. Their parents see this as a betrayal of family honor and have threatened to disown them if they continue. Gareth now studies magic in isolation, using their warrior training to defend their secret study spot from curious clan members.

**Traits**:
- **Class**: Wizard
- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Level**: 1
- **Ideal**: Self-improvement (they believe magic makes them stronger)
- **Bond**: The spell scroll that changed their life
- **Flaw**: Fear of being disowned

**Stats**: High Intelligence, low Charisma (shy and isolated), moderate Dexterity (from warrior training)

### Example 4: Dorin Brightforge
**Keywords**: dwarf, timid, wizard apprentice, family opposition

**Bio**: A bashful dwarf secretly learning magic, defying their traditionalist parents who believe magic corrupts the soul and weakens the body.

**Backstory**: Dorin's parents are devout followers of a dwarven religion that teaches that magic is a dangerous temptation that leads to moral decay. They raised Dorin to believe that physical strength and craftsmanship are the only honorable pursuits. However, after accidentally casting a minor cantrip during a moment of stress, Dorin realized they have a natural talent for magic. Terrified of their parents' reaction, they began studying in secret with a reclusive mage who lives in the mountains. Every day, they must choose between their family's love and their magical calling.

**Traits**:
- **Class**: Wizard
- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Level**: 1
- **Ideal**: Freedom (they believe everyone should choose their own path)
- **Bond**: The reclusive mage who teaches them
- **Flaw**: Constant fear of discovery and rejection

**Stats**: High Intelligence, very low Charisma (timid and fearful), moderate Wisdom (from religious upbringing)

### Example 5: Korin Deepdelver
**Keywords**: shy, dwarf, wizard training, against wishes

**Bio**: A withdrawn dwarf studying spells in secret, pursuing magic against their miner family's expectations that they would work the family mine.

**Backstory**: Korin's parents own a profitable mine and expected their child to inherit the business and continue the family legacy. However, Korin was always more interested in the strange crystals and magical energies found deep in the mines than in extracting ore. After discovering that some crystals could store magical energy, Korin began teaching themselves basic spells using these natural foci. Their parents see this as a waste of time and have repeatedly tried to force them to focus on mining. Korin now practices magic in the deepest, most isolated tunnels, using the mine's natural magical properties to enhance their learning.

**Traits**:
- **Class**: Wizard
- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Level**: 1
- **Ideal**: Discovery (they want to understand the magic in the mines)
- **Bond**: The magical crystals they use as spell foci
- **Flaw**: Inability to stand up to their parents directly

**Stats**: High Intelligence, low Charisma (withdrawn and isolated), high Constitution (from working in mines)

## Analysis Summary

### What All Good Examples Have in Common:

1. **Race is dwarf** - Never changed or ignored
2. **Class is wizard/spellcaster** - Never changed or ignored
3. **Level is 1** - Appropriate for "training to become"
4. **Shyness is evident** - Timid, reserved, quiet, secretive behavior
5. **Family conflict is explicit** - Parents disapprove for specific reasons (tradition, honor, religion, business)
6. **Training is happening** - They are actively learning, not already a master
7. **Coherent motivation** - Why they want magic connects to their backstory
8. **Third-person grammar** - No "I/me/my" references
9. **Specific details** - Concrete reasons for conflict, specific methods of training
10. **Logical connections** - All elements (shyness, training, conflict) connect naturally

### What Makes These Interpretations Strong:

- **Specificity**: Instead of "parents disapprove," we get "miners who see magic as waste of time" or "warriors who see it as cowardly"
- **Coherence**: The shyness makes sense with the secret training; the conflict explains why they're secretive
- **Creativity**: Each NPC has a unique reason for the conflict and method of training
- **Usability**: A DM can immediately use these NPCs - they have clear motivations, conflicts, and hooks
